# Smartyield - Sustainable yield farming

## ü§î What is this?
Smartyield is a Proof of Concept yield farm with the idea of sustainable yield farming, preventing a downwards spiral due to farming incentives being unsustainable and lacking benefits for the yield token.

## ‚ùì How can Smartyield be sustainable?
To be sustainable, the farming deposits need to benefit the protocol in some way. The plan for Smartyield is to offer regular pools + so called "death pools". For each single token pool, there would be a "death pool" where the yield token is paired with the single token. From there, single token deposits would be taxed, this tax would go directly into the pool, increasing the liquidity on the single token's side, both helping the price and liquidity on that side. This may also create opportunity, if the single token has a diverse amount of pairs, it could create potential arbitrage opportunites for others to seize.

## üí° What was the inspiration for this idea?
The inspiration for this came primarily from YieldScienceLab's "Lab Accident" tokenomics. I found it to be quite interesting and decided to explore the idea for myself a bit.
